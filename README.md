# fractals

## Author
This project is made by Simon Thor in 2019.

## Overview
It is an extremely poorly managed project, as I have never used Github before. Furthermore, no code has been commented. The code is also poorly written.

## Functionality
The project can generate fractals. 
- interactive_fractal.py file can have interactive excape-time fractals, meaning that the user can zoom in and out by clicking on the image.
- fractals.py provides more extensive options of fractals, including (but not limited to) sierpinski's triangle and the Koch snowflake (sort of).

## Prerequisites
- numpy
- matplotlib
- numba
